# ðŸ”· Azure Learning Notes

This repository is my personal documentation of learning **Microsoft Azure Cloud**, structured day by day.  

Each day contains:
- âœ… Key concepts I studied  
- ðŸ›  Hands-on exercises I tried  
- ðŸ’¡ Reflections and takeaways  

The goal is to track my progress and build a solid foundation in Azure services, while building a portfolio I can share with future employers.
